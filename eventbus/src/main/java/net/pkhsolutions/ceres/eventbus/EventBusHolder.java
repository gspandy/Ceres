 * This class provides static methods for setting and accessing an event bus. It
 * can be used to simply code where multiple objects need access to the event
 * bus. Instead of passing in the event bus instance to all objects, they can
 * look it up themselves. <p> Note, however, that if you are using a dependency
 * injection framework (such as CDI or Spring), it is probably better to use
 * that to inject the event bus reference into the objects that need it. <p>
 * This class is thread safe.
